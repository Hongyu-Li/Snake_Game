# Snake Game

Are you working in a sitting position right now? Feeling pains about your stiff neck and tight shoulders? If so, you're gonna love our game! 


## How to play? 

In this game, you have to use your head gestures to guide the snake to gain score as high as possible.

## Development Environment

This demo was inspired by tensorflowjs [Pac-Man demo](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos/). 

* Model: We used the idea of *transfer learning* to train the model with **Tensorflow 2.0** on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The training process and the architecture of the model could be found in `/src/Snake-Game-Alpha.ipynb`
* UI: `Typescript ` + `React` + `Mobx`  


## TODO

- [ ] Deploy online

- [ ] Recognize hand gesture to start/restart the game

- [ ] Prettier UI


## Acknowledge

Code borrows heavily from [Pac-Man](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/webcam-transfer-learning).
